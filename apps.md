# [Is Linux About]({{ site.baseurl }}/) Apps?

## No.

Linux is a kernel, not an app platform. While you can use some apps across several different Linux-based OSes, many apps are only designed to integrate with a specific platform like GNOME, KDE, elementary OS, etc.

- Ubuntu, one of the most popular Linux desktop distributions, **uses their own Snap packaging technology and app store** which is not included in any other Linux-based OS.

- Some platforms like [elementary OS AppCenter](https://developer.elementary.io) **require apps to use the native toolkit** for the OS, and only include those apps made specifically for elementary OS in their app store by default.

## Maybe?

What many refer to as "Desktop Linux" _is_ becomming easier to target as an app platform thanks to cross-project collaboration.

- [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org) is a containerized app packaging format that is widely used: Clear Linux, elementary OS, Endless OS, Fedora, KDE Neon, Linux Mint, Manjaro, Pop!_OS, PureOS, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Solus, Zorin OS, and many more **include Flatpak support out of the box.**

- [Flathub](https://flathub.org) is the defacto app store for all of Linux with thousands of apps, hundreds of apps verified by their own developers, and **over a billion app installs.** It's a true community-led independent joint effort from GNOME, KDE, and independent contributors.

- [FreeDesktop.org](https://freedesktop.org) specifications help **ensure cross-compatibility between Linux-based desktops**.

- [Portals](https://docs.flatpak.org/en/latest/desktop-integration.html#portals) provide apps well-defined, **widely-supported APIs that work across OSes and desktop environments.**

- The [Linux App Summit](https://linuxappsummit.org/) is an annual get-together with people working to **create and grow a broad "Linux app ecosystem."**
